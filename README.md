My personal configs.

Running `init.(sh|cmd)` will simlink `$HOME/{file}` to `path/to/.dotfiles/{file}`, and back up the original in `path/to/.dotfiles/backup/` as well as pull in all the vim plugin submodules and install emacs packages with cask.

Requirements:
- `cask`
- `org-mode` repo installed in `$HOME/src/`
- `oh-my-zsh`

Configs for:
- bash
- zsh
- tmux
- git
- total commander
- midnight commander
- little scripts for launching JetBrains IDE from command line
- vim
- emacs
- sublime text 3
- atom
- brackets
